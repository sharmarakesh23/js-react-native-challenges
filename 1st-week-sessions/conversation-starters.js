/* 
  Here are two profile objects 
  Your challenge is to write a function called `createConversationStarters`
  that will parse these objects and match up common attributes,

  The expected output of this function can be an array or string that says something like:
  `You both live in mumbai
  she is from the Marathi community as well`

  Hint: you can use using object access syntax, 
  basic conditionals and array manipulation to solve this challenge
